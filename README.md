Select difficulty and start the game! Each time you get a new randomly generated maze. Collect the coins while avoiding the holes.

Increasing the difficulty makes the game more challenging as the holes are larger and more frequent. But you get more points from each collected coin.

Collect all the coins and a new level with the same difficulty settings will be generated. Get as high score as possible!
